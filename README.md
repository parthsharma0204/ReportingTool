# ReportingTool
This project is a comprehensive reporting tool designed to streamline the management of defaulters. The tool provides a robust platform for users to search, report, monitor, and compile a personalized list of defaulters. Key features include a user-friendly interface for logging in, signing up, and recovering forgotten passwords. The tool also includes settings for users to customize their experience. Through this application, organizations can efficiently track defaulters, ensuring timely actions and improved accountability. The project emphasizes security and ease of use, making it an invaluable resource for entities requiring meticulous defaulter management. By integrating these functionalities, the tool aims to enhance operational efficiency and data accuracy in monitoring and reporting defaulters.

This project is a sophisticated reporting tool built using a modern web development stack. The primary technologies employed include MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, EJS modules, and Bcrypt, each playing a crucial role in the functionality and security of the application.

MongoDB is utilized as the database to store and manage data on defaulters efficiently. Its flexible schema design allows for seamless data storage and retrieval, supporting complex queries and real-time updates. Express.js serves as the web application framework, facilitating the development of robust and scalable server-side applications. It provides essential features for routing, middleware integration, and HTTP request handling.

Node.js, the runtime environment, ensures that the application is fast and responsive by enabling server-side scripting with JavaScript. This enhances performance and scalability, essential for handling numerous concurrent users. The EJS (Embedded JavaScript) modules are used for templating, allowing dynamic generation of HTML pages based on the data from the server. This ensures a smooth and interactive user experience.

Security is a top priority in this project. Bcrypt is implemented for password hashing, safeguarding user credentials against potential breaches. This cryptographic algorithm ensures that passwords are stored securely, protecting sensitive user information.

Together, these technologies create a powerful tool that enables users to search, report, monitor, and compile lists of defaulters. The application supports essential features such as login, signup, password recovery, and customizable settings, making it an indispensable resource for efficient defaulter management.

The database design for this reporting tool focuses on two primary entities: the reporter and the defaulter. Each entity is structured to ensure comprehensive data management, integrity, and efficiency.

### Reporter Database

The reporter database stores information about users who interact with the system. It includes details such as:

- **User ID:** A unique identifier for each reporter, ensuring that data can be accurately linked to the correct user.
- **Username:** A unique name chosen by the user for login and display purposes.
- **Email:** Contact information for the reporter, used for notifications and account recovery.
- **Password:** Encrypted using Bcrypt to enhance security and protect against unauthorized access.
- **Role:** Specifies the user’s role within the system, such as admin or regular user, determining their access levels and permissions.
- **Created At:** Timestamp indicating when the reporter account was created, useful for auditing and tracking purposes.
- **Updated At:** Timestamp for the last update made to the reporter’s information, aiding in maintaining current data.

### Defaulter Database

The defaulter database keeps detailed records of individuals or entities reported for defaulting. It includes:

- **Defaulter ID:** A unique identifier for each defaulter, ensuring precise tracking and management.
- **Name:** The name of the defaulter, which could be an individual or an entity.
- **Contact Information:** Includes phone numbers, email addresses, and possibly physical addresses to facilitate communication.
- **Default Details:** Specific information about the default, such as the nature, amount, and date of default.
- **Reporter ID:** Links to the reporter who submitted the defaulter’s information, creating a relational database that maintains accountability.
- **Status:** Indicates the current status of the default (e.g., pending, resolved, under investigation).
- **Notes:** Additional remarks or comments related to the defaulter’s case, providing context and supporting information.
- **Created At:** Timestamp indicating when the defaulter record was created.
- **Updated At:** Timestamp for the last update made to the defaulter’s information.

### Database Design and Relationships

The database is designed to be highly relational, ensuring that records in the reporter and defaulter databases can be linked effectively. This relational aspect is critical for maintaining data integrity and enabling complex queries, such as retrieving all defaulters reported by a specific user or tracking the history of reports linked to a particular defaulter.

### Security and Performance

Both databases employ MongoDB’s schema design capabilities to ensure scalability and flexibility. Indexing is used to enhance query performance, while Bcrypt’s hashing algorithm secures sensitive information, particularly user passwords. This dual focus on security and performance ensures that the application can handle large volumes of data and concurrent users without compromising on speed or data protection.

By maintaining detailed and well-structured databases for reporters and defaulters, the application provides a robust foundation for effective defaulter management, supporting comprehensive search, reporting, and monitoring functionalities.
